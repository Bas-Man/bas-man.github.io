I had previously done this moving from Jessie.
Whilst I had no real issues with task following the guides that I found. I did discover one thing that concerned me, and was missing from the guides.
After upgrading to Buster, my /boot had less than 200kb of free storage.
I did some reading and found that Buster seems to need a lot more space in /boot than for previous releases.</description></item></channel></rss>
