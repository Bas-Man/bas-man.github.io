I have turned my eye to a and mx mechanisms. As I started looking at the a mechanism. I noticed that my current approach using the standard string functions would probably be fairly difficult to implement. So I started to think about using the Regex crate. So this will be a look at how that went.</description></item><item><title>Rust Basic Testing</title><link>https://bas-man.github.io/post/rust-basic-testing/</link><pubDate>Mon, 19 Apr 2021 15:00:00 +0900</pubDate><guid>https://bas-man.github.io/post/rust-basic-testing/</guid><description>As I work through learning rust, I figured it was time to to start doing actual testing.
Why Test Simple, it&amp;rsquo;s really essential when building anything beyond a few lines of simple code. Being able to run a series of reproducible tests as you develop; allows you to ensure that changes you make are not breaking exisiting code. You also have the option to develop using TDD.
Of course I have not adhered to any of this as I explore the basics of working with rust.</description></item><item><title>Manage Rust Code by Breaking it Up</title><link>https://bas-man.github.io/post/manage-rust-code-by-breaking-it-up/</link><pubDate>Wed, 14 Apr 2021 15:25:30 +0900</pubDate><guid>https://bas-man.github.io/post/manage-rust-code-by-breaking-it-up/</guid><description>We often start small coding projects, and we often tend to start them off in a single file. But sometimes, the project naturally grows larger and more complex. The code thus becomes more difficult to manage in a single file.
At these times we often need to break the code up across multiple files so that we can focus on a particular functionality. This is where I found myself as I am toying with my SPF code.</description></item><item><title>Deconstructing SPF with Rust using Generics</title><link>https://bas-man.github.io/post/deconstructing-spf-with-rust-using-generics/</link><pubDate>Sat, 10 Apr 2021 23:30:00 +0900</pubDate><guid>https://bas-man.github.io/post/deconstructing-spf-with-rust-using-generics/</guid><description>As I mentioned in my previous article Deconstructing SPF Records with Rust. There is a case for using generics given the amount of overlap between the different mechanisms.
So in this article I will document how I transitioned from using unique structs for each mechanism, leading to less overall code and other benefits.
While I was considering how best to go about doing generics, I came across this very nice write up on dev.</description></item><item><title>Deconstructing SPF Records with Rust</title><link>https://bas-man.github.io/post/deconstructing-spf-with-rust/</link><pubDate>Thu, 08 Apr 2021 10:00:00 +0900</pubDate><guid>https://bas-man.github.io/post/deconstructing-spf-with-rust/</guid><description>Hi. If you have visited my blog before you might have seen my series on using the trust-dns-resolver crate. As part of that series I looked at querying DNS TXT records. During the process I was reminded of SPF records. Something I used to deal with in a previous position. And this got me to thinking about using SPF records as a way to learn more about working with rust.</description></item><item><title>TXT lookup using the trust-dns-resolver Crate</title><link>https://bas-man.github.io/post/rust-trust-dns-resolver-txt-lookup/</link><pubDate>Mon, 29 Mar 2021 11:30:00 +0900</pubDate><guid>https://bas-man.github.io/post/rust-trust-dns-resolver-txt-lookup/</guid><description>This is the third article on using the trust-dns-resolver crate.</description></item><item><title>SOA lookup using the trust-dns-resolver Crate</title><link>https://bas-man.github.io/post/rust-trust-dns-resolver-soa-lookup/</link><pubDate>Fri, 26 Mar 2021 12:00:00 +0900</pubDate><guid>https://bas-man.github.io/post/rust-trust-dns-resolver-soa-lookup/</guid><description>This is a second article on using the trust-dns-resolver crate.</description></item><item><title>MX and Host lookup using the trust-dns-resolver Crate</title><link>https://bas-man.github.io/post/rust-trust-dns-resolver-mx-and-host-lookup/</link><pubDate>Thu, 25 Mar 2021 15:00:00 +0900</pubDate><guid>https://bas-man.github.io/post/rust-trust-dns-resolver-mx-and-host-lookup/</guid><description>I used to often work with DNS in one of my previous jobs. So I have always had a long running interesting in DNS. Most recently I have been looking into Rust. I wanted to see how easy it might be to use rust to access DNS records, one; because rust is said to be fast, and also because it&amp;rsquo;s a safe programming language.
This will be a brief write up at my attempt to use trust-dns-resolver to do MX record lookups and subsequently host address lookups.</description></item></channel></rss>
