The Solution Github Actions.
I already push updates to my site using github actions. So I thought why not have articles published in the future after they are written.
A little background. I do all my edits in a private GitHub repo. When I push to master in this repo.</description></item><item><title>Private Hugo Repo to Public on Github</title><link>https://bas-man.github.io/post/hugo-private-to-public-github/</link><pubDate>Thu, 06 Aug 2020 16:51:00 +0900</pubDate><guid>https://bas-man.github.io/post/hugo-private-to-public-github/</guid><description>I was researching ways of moving to Hugo for my site generator. I looked at a few options and as part of this I came a cross a workflow in github that allows me to store my site in a private repo and then publish the site to a public repo without too much fuss.
You can find the action here
I use the basic example config with minor changes to match my GitHub details.</description></item><item><title>CI on Github for Python</title><link>https://bas-man.github.io/post/github-python-action/</link><pubDate>Tue, 04 Aug 2020 00:00:00 +0900</pubDate><guid>https://bas-man.github.io/post/github-python-action/</guid><description>So I finally thought it was time to start doing some continuous intergration testing as well as testing with multiple versions of Python.
I had been looking at using things such as CircleCI or Travis-ci. But I finally decided I would try to use Github&amp;rsquo;s workflow actions.
I did some searching and found some guides. As part of that I evenutally came a cross this link on Github&amp;rsquo;s own docs.</description></item></channel></rss>
