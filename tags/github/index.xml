I looked at few options and as part of this I came a cross a workflow in github that allows me to store my site in a private repo and then publish the site to a public repo without too much fuss.
You can find the action here

I had been looking at using things such as CircleCI or Travis-ci. But I finally decided I would try to use Github&amp;rsquo;s workflow actions.
I did some searching and found some guides. As part of that I evenutally came a cross this link on Github&amp;rsquo;s own docs.</description></item></channel></rss>
