Fortunately this is a common problem. So I have found some references for this. Also one of my favourite tools for developing regex expressions, Regex101, also offers support in this area.
I found this useful Github Gist.
note:
You should also check the gist directly as there are some follow up comments and additions.</description></item></channel></rss>
