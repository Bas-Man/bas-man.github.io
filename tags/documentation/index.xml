&lt;p>I have been working on this project on and off for a bit now. So I thought it was time to go over how we might be able to not only internally document our code, but also to document it at the package level.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Rust: Move from binary to library and Add Documentation Examples that are tested.</title><link>https://bas-man.github.io/post/rust/rust-move-to-crate-add-testable-documentation/</link><pubDate>Tue, 11 May 2021 13:30:00 +0900</pubDate><guid>https://bas-man.github.io/post/rust/rust-move-to-crate-add-testable-documentation/</guid><description>&lt;p>In the previous article in this &lt;a href="https://bas-man.github.io/series/learning-rust/">series&lt;/a> I went through some basics of documenting your rust code.

As with all projects. It&amp;rsquo;s important to create documentation. This is, as we know, very important when creating code.
