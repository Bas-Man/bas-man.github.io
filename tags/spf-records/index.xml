There is a case for using generics given the amount of overlap between the different mechanisms.
So in this article I will document how I transitioned from using unique structs for each mechanism, leading to less overall code and other benefits.
While I was considering how best to go about doing generics, I came across this very nice write up on dev.</description></item><item><title>Deconstructing SPF Records with Rust</title><link>https://bas-man.github.io/post/rust/deconstructing-spf-with-rust/</link><pubDate>Thu, 08 Apr 2021 10:00:00 +0900</pubDate><guid>https://bas-man.github.io/post/rust/deconstructing-spf-with-rust/</guid><description>Hi. If you have visited my blog before you might have seen my series on using the trust-dns-resolver crate. As part of that series I looked at querying DNS TXT records. During the process I was reminded of SPF records. Something I used to deal with in a previous position. And this got me to thinking about using SPF records as a way to learn more about working with rust.</description></item></channel></rss>
