As part of this I thought it was time to stop cpan testers from testing my module under Windows since it is currently not really supported.
I was not sure how to go about doing this, so I reached out the good people in the &amp;ldquo;Perl Programmers&amp;rdquo; group on FaceBook. I got some great links and suggestions.</description></item></channel></rss>
