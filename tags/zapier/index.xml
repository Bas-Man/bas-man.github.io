Why would I want to do this?
I use the free tier. (The process only runs once every 15 minutes. It used to be once every 5 mins.) Which means it has become a bit slow in sending the notifications. I want to learn how to use Docker Once I get a bit further along I will hopefully publish the python code to GitHub and document some of the issues and successes as I move along.</description></item><item><title>Gmail Zapier LINE Notify</title><link>https://bas-man.github.io/docs/gmail-zapier-line-notify/</link><pubDate>Fri, 24 Jul 2020 15:44:35 +0900</pubDate><guid>https://bas-man.github.io/docs/gmail-zapier-line-notify/</guid><description>This documents how I setup integration between these three services.</description></item></channel></rss>
