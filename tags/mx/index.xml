So I have always had a long running interesting in DNS. Most recently I have been looking into Rust. I wanted to see how easy it might be to use rust to access DNS records, one; because rust is said to be fast, and also because it&amp;rsquo;s a safe programming language.
This will be a brief write up at my attempt to use trust-dns-resolver to do MX record lookups and subsequently host address lookups.</description></item></channel></rss>
