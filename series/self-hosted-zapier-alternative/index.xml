As part of this, I have been working on dealing with unicode characters in regex.
In relation to this I have found that I am writing the same function repeatedly. The only difference being the number matches being returned. So I decided we need to refactor this.</description></item><item><title>Project: Self Hosted Zapier Alternative</title><link>https://bas-man.github.io/post/self-hosted-zapier-alternative/</link><pubDate>Sat, 02 Jan 2021 23:00:39 +0900</pubDate><guid>https://bas-man.github.io/post/self-hosted-zapier-alternative/</guid><description>I am currently in the process of working out how I might replace some of my Zapier services. Why would I want to do this?
I use the free tier. (The process only runs once every 15 minutes. It used to be once every 5 mins.) Which means it has become a bit slow in sending the notifications. I want to learn how to use Docker Once I get a bit further along I will hopefully publish the python code to GitHub and document some of the issues and successes as I move along.</description></item></channel></rss>
