Why Test Simple, it&amp;rsquo;s really essential when building anything beyond a few lines of simple code. Being able to run a series of reproducible tests as you develop; allows you to ensure that changes you make are not breaking exisiting code. You also have the option to develop using TDD.
Of course I have not adhered to any of this as I explore the basics of working with rust.</description></item><item><title>Manage Rust Code by Breaking it Up</title><link>https://bas-man.github.io/post/manage-rust-code-by-breaking-it-up/</link><pubDate>Wed, 14 Apr 2021 15:25:30 +0900</pubDate><guid>https://bas-man.github.io/post/manage-rust-code-by-breaking-it-up/</guid><description>We often start small coding projects, and we often tend to start them off in a single file. But sometimes, the project naturally grows larger and more complex. The code thus becomes more difficult to manage in a single file.
At these times we often need to break the code up across multiple files so that we can focus on a particular functionality. This is where I found myself as I am toying with my SPF code.</description></item><item><title>Deconstructing SPF with Rust using Generics</title><link>https://bas-man.github.io/post/deconstructing-spf-with-rust-using-generics/</link><pubDate>Sat, 10 Apr 2021 23:30:00 +0900</pubDate><guid>https://bas-man.github.io/post/deconstructing-spf-with-rust-using-generics/</guid><description>As I mentioned in my previous article Deconstructing SPF Records with Rust.

If you have visited my blog before you might have seen my series on using the trust-dns-resolver crate. As part of that series I looked at querying DNS TXT records.

I use the free tier. (The process only runs once every 15 minutes. It used to be once every 5 mins.) Which means it has become a bit slow in sending the notifications.

Whilst I had no real issues with task following the guides that I found. I did discover one thing that concerned me, and was missing from the guides.
After upgrading to Buster, my /boot had less than 200kb of free storage.
I did some reading and found that Buster seems to need a lot more space in /boot than for previous releases.</description></item><item><title>Bind DNS Setup</title><link>https://bas-man.github.io/docs/bind-dns-setup/</link><pubDate>Fri, 27 Nov 2020 17:30:00 +0900</pubDate><guid>https://bas-man.github.io/docs/bind-dns-setup/</guid><description>A guide on setting up a caching and authoritative name server.</description></item><item><title>Presence Detection with BLE using monitor.sh &amp; Home Assistant</title><link>https://bas-man.github.io/post/ble-presence-detection-home-assistant/</link><pubDate>Thu, 12 Nov 2020 10:35:00 +0900</pubDate><guid>https://bas-man.github.io/post/ble-presence-detection-home-assistant/</guid><description>I have been running Home Assistant for a while. Things are going well. But I have had some issues with presence detection using the standard device_tracker component. Though I live in a small place, being in Tokyo, Home Assistant sometimes stops detecting phones if they are in an area of the apartment a little away from the Home Assistant server. This I suspect is due to the position of the Raspberry Pi and the building material.</description></item><item><title>Use launchd instead of crontab on your Mac</title><link>https://bas-man.github.io/post/launchd-instead-of-cron/</link><pubDate>Tue, 18 Aug 2020 16:30:00 +0900</pubDate><guid>https://bas-man.github.io/post/launchd-instead-of-cron/</guid><description>As of Mac OS 10.4 crontab has been depreciated but not ended. So its a good idea to know how to use its replacement under Mac OS. Welcome to Launchd.
This will be a short guide on how to use launchd in a simple form to replace a crontab job. In my case I am automating the backup of my Plex server. You can see my previous article here

The Solution Github Actions.
I already push updates to my site using github actions. So I thought why not have articles published in the future after they are written.
A little background. I do all my edits in a private GitHub repo. When I push to master in this repo.</description></item><item><title>Private Hugo Repo to Public on Github</title><link>https://bas-man.github.io/post/hugo-private-to-public-github/</link><pubDate>Thu, 06 Aug 2020 16:51:00 +0900</pubDate><guid>https://bas-man.github.io/post/hugo-private-to-public-github/</guid><description>I was researching ways of moving to Hugo for my site generator. I looked at a few options and as part of this I came a cross a workflow in github that allows me to store my site in a private repo and then publish the site to a public repo without too much fuss.
You can find the action here
I use the basic example config with minor changes to match my GitHub details.</description></item><item><title>CI on Github for Python</title><link>https://bas-man.github.io/post/github-python-action/</link><pubDate>Tue, 04 Aug 2020 00:00:00 +0900</pubDate><guid>https://bas-man.github.io/post/github-python-action/</guid><description>So I finally thought it was time to start doing some continuous intergration testing as well as testing with multiple versions of Python.
I had been looking at using things such as CircleCI or Travis-ci. But I finally decided I would try to use Github&amp;rsquo;s workflow actions.
I did some searching and found some guides. As part of that I evenutally came a cross this link on Github&amp;rsquo;s own docs.</description></item><item><title>Gmail Zapier LINE Notify</title><link>https://bas-man.github.io/docs/gmail-zapier-line-notify/</link><pubDate>Fri, 24 Jul 2020 15:44:35 +0900</pubDate><guid>https://bas-man.github.io/docs/gmail-zapier-line-notify/</guid><description>This documents how I setup integration between these three services.</description></item><item><title>Add a cookie warning notice to a Hugo powered site</title><link>https://bas-man.github.io/post/add-cookie-warning/</link><pubDate>Thu, 16 Jul 2020 00:00:00 +0900</pubDate><guid>https://bas-man.github.io/post/add-cookie-warning/</guid><description>The Challenge How to add a cookie warning notice to a Hugo powered website.

Solution A Bash Script
I wanted to automate this process. If I didn&amp;rsquo;t, it probably wouldn&amp;rsquo;t get done.
This script was adapted from another GitHub Gist that I found here.
You will probably need to modify the following variables.
plexDatabase plexPlistFile backupDirectory Pay attention to lines 17 ~ 21. These refer to the possibility that your script may not complete if your machine can go to sleep.</description></item><item><title>Delay Services launch until external drive mount is complete</title><link>https://bas-man.github.io/post/startup-apple-script/</link><pubDate>Thu, 14 May 2020 14:30:00 +0900</pubDate><guid>https://bas-man.github.io/post/startup-apple-script/</guid><description>The Challenge How to give Drobo time to mount before processes that need access to it begin and hence block it&amp;rsquo;s mounting by having the mount point in use.
Solution AppleScript
Why was this an issue for me. Well I have a Drobo drive which is over 75% full. As a result it can take a while to mount and be detected by my old Mac Mini. This would mean that processes that use files from the Drobo would start before it was mounted.</description></item><item><title>Site Launch</title><link>https://bas-man.github.io/post/site-launched/</link><pubDate>Mon, 11 May 2020 00:00:00 +0900</pubDate><guid>https://bas-man.github.io/post/site-launched/</guid><description>Well.

I will try to post some of my small personal projects and thoughts here. I will also probably create a cheat sheet for myself.
Anyway, I shall see how it goes.</description></item></channel></rss>
