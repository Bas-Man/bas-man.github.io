Solution: A Bash Script
I wanted to automate this process. If I didn&amp;rsquo;t, it probably wouldn&amp;rsquo;t get done.
This script was adapted from another GitHub Gist that I found here.
You will probably need to modify the following variables.
plexDatabase plexPlistFile backupDirectory Pay attention to lines 17 ~ 21. These refer to the possibility that your script may not complete if your machine can go to sleep.</description></item><item><title>Delay Services launch until external drive mount is complete.</title><link>https://bas-man.github.io/post/startup-apple-script/</link><pubDate>Thu, 14 May 2020 14:30:00 +0900</pubDate><guid>https://bas-man.github.io/post/startup-apple-script/</guid><description>The Challenge: How to give Drobo time to mount before processes that need access to it begin and hence block it&amp;rsquo;s mounting by having the mount point in use.
Solution: AppleScript
Why was this an issue for me. Well I have a Drobo drive which is over 75% full. As a result it can take a while to mount and be detected by my old Mac Mini. This would mean that processes that use files from the Drobo would start before it was mounted.</description></item><item><title>Site Launch.</title><link>https://bas-man.github.io/post/site-launched/</link><pubDate>Mon, 11 May 2020 00:00:00 +0900</pubDate><guid>https://bas-man.github.io/post/site-launched/</guid><description>Well. Finally got around to putting this site together. Actually this is attempt number two.
I will try to post some of my small personal projects and thoughts here. I will also probably create a cheat sheet for myself.
Anyway, I shall see how it goes.</description></item></channel></rss>
