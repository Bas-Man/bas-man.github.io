I had previously done this moving from Jessie.
Whilst I had no real issues with task following the guides that I found. I did discover one thing that concerned me, and was missing from the guides.
After upgrading to Buster, my /boot had less than 200kb of free storage.
I did some reading and found that Buster seems to need a lot more space in /boot than for previous releases.</description></item><item><title>Presence Detection with BLE using monitor.sh &amp; Home Assistant</title><link>https://bas-man.github.io/post/ble-presence-detection-home-assistant/</link><pubDate>Thu, 12 Nov 2020 10:35:00 +0900</pubDate><guid>https://bas-man.github.io/post/ble-presence-detection-home-assistant/</guid><description>I have been running Home Assistant for a while. Things are going well. But I have had some issues with presence detection using the standard device_tracker component. Though I live in a small place, being in Tokyo, Home Assistant sometimes stops detecting phones if they are in an area of the apartment a little away from the Home Assistant server. This I suspect is due to the position of the Raspberry Pi and the building material.</description></item></channel></rss>
