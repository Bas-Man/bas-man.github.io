AppDaemon with Home Assistant.</title><link>https://bas-man.github.io/post/home-assistant-adddaemon-line-notification/</link><pubDate>Thu, 17 Dec 2020 23:00:00 +0900</pubDate><guid>https://bas-man.github.io/post/home-assistant-adddaemon-line-notification/</guid><description>The challenge. Living in Japan we generally default to using LINE for our messaging needs. At the time of this writing there is no integration for LINE within Home Assistant. Currently I use PushOver for some of my Home Assistant notifications. I also use Zapier with email to trigger notifications to my family LINE group. You can see how I did this here and here.
I also track some Tile devices to know when family members are home.</description></item></channel></rss>
