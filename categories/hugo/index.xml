Today I would like to go over how I changed things up a bit and am now able to push my site updates to GitHub, which then pushes the updates to the live production server. This should allow me to add checks within GitHub to ensure my site it updated only if everything is correct. Though I won&amp;rsquo;t go into that here today. I will be focusing on the GitHub Action.</description></item><item><title>Auto Update Site from a Git Push</title><link>https://bas-man.github.io/post/git/auto-update-site-from-git-push/</link><pubDate>Tue, 22 Jun 2021 14:40:00 +0900</pubDate><guid>https://bas-man.github.io/post/git/auto-update-site-from-git-push/</guid><description>&lt;p>Hi,&lt;/p>
&lt;p>For a little while now I have been thinking about moving my personal blog to a self-hosted service. One of the options I have been considering is &lt;a href="https://www.linode.com">Linode&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>As part of this idea. I wanted to see how I might be able to automate some of the processes. This is just a write up on one of my ideas so far.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Add a New Social to Beautifulhugo</title><link>https://bas-man.github.io/post/add-new-social-beautifulhugo/</link><pubDate>Sun, 25 Apr 2021 23:00:00 +0900</pubDate><guid>https://bas-man.github.io/post/add-new-social-beautifulhugo/</guid><description>Fairly recently I changed my theme for my personal blog. I switched to Beautifulhugo. I find it to be a nice clean theme.
Beautifulhugo supports a lot of social sites. However, it is also missing some that I like. In particular Dev.to and Flipboard.
I had previously added these to the other theme I was using. So I went about adding them to Beautifulhugo.
Adding a Dev.to Social Link I started with a quick search to see if there was any guide regarding dev.</description></item></channel></rss>
